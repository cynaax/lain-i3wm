# lain-i3wm
My first proper submission to Github, of course it was a Rice, but it looks very nice.

### Needed deps:
`pywal` self explanatory

`wpgtk` allows you to edit the colours or randomize them, plus more (uses pywal as it's backend)

`chameleon` creates a gtk theme based on the colours taken from pywal

`nitrogen` sets the desired wallpaper, I used to use Feh but this is easier

`picom` compositor

(I will be adding more as time goes on)

## Optional deps:

``cava`` terminal based audio visualizer

``cordless`` because I like it

``spotify-tui`` works better, and faster

``oomox`` just because

``pywalfox`` edits the firefox css to that of the colours pywal generated

``ranger`` terminal based file manager, just because

Psst, I might as well drop a background folder into there, not everything will be Lain related though
